        <h2>Who are we</h2>
        <p>
          We are a team of software developers. We believe that web is
          <em>the</em> information source and communication channel of the
          present and the future. That's why we decided to focus our further
          learning on web related technologies.

          Resumo d.o.o. company was founded in 2009 by

        <h2>Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          We use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, React and Angular for
          client-side development and Node.js and .NET for server-side
          development.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="how-we-work" aria-label="How we work">
        <h2>How we work</h2>
        <p>
          We prefer to use agile development process - continuous releases in
          small, fixed iterations and test driven development for quality
          assurance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditional software development was based on the idea that
          requirements for software projects are fixed and possible to write in
          advance. That almost never worked. Projects collapsed, schedules were
          broken and programmers were frustrated. Changes in requirements in the
          middle of the fixed sized projects tend to do that. Why change
          requirements? Because the market changes, or new ideas come up, or
          some part of the planned system is not needed anymore. The client
          expects to be able to add or change project features inside the same
          budget. Developers don't expect that.
        </p>
        <p>
          So after a while, some smart developers invented a project management
          technique which is actually expecting requirements to change. They
          called it Agile Development. It is based on fixed sized deliveries in
          short "sprints" - development cycles that are two or four weeks long.
          This way, client can see the software features while it is under
          development. It is possible to give up from a requirement which is not
          yet developed. It is possible to change the requirement. It is
          possible to stop the project at the end of each sprint; or extend the
          project by adding new features and sprints. Nothing is fixed, you just
          subscribe to sprints and stop the subscription when you decide that
          the software is complete. That's how we would like to work. Agile
          development reduces the risk for both the client and the developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are aware that sometimes you have a fixed budget and there is no
          room for flexible sprints in development. In that case we have to be
          clear we understand the requirements so we can estimate the cost of
          the development in advance.

        <h2>Why us</h2>
        <p>
          People in the team have more than 20 years combined experience in
          software development. We have worked with various technologies like
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular 1 and 2+, Cordova, Ionic,
          Ruby on Rails, iOS, .NET Framework (ASP.NET, WPF, WCF, Silverlight),
          PhoneGap, SQL Server, Oracle database, Autodesk GIS Servers, etc. From
          this technology mix we have learned the major patterns and concepts on
          which they are based. We use that knowledge in our current projects,
          improving the overall quality of the software. We think we provide
          good value for the time and money.
